# Intrusion-Detection-System
With the enormous growth of computer networks usage and the huge increase in the number of applications running on top of it, network security is becoming increasingly more important. Intrusion detection is a critical component of cybersecurity, helping organizations safeguard their systems and networks from unauthorized access and potential threats. Continuous monitoring, analysis, and a proactive response are essential elements in building an effective intrusion detection strategy. The primary goal of intrusion detection is to identify and respond to security incidents promptly, mitigating potential damage to the system or network. Therefore, the role of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), as special purpose devices to detect anomalies and attacks in the network, is becoming more important. The research in the intrusion detection field has been mostly focused on anomaly-based and misuse-based detection techniques for a long time. Conducting a thorough analysis of the recent research trend in anomaly detection, one will encounter several machine learning methods reported to have a very high detection rate of 98% while keeping the false alarm rate at 1%.

KDD'99 has been the most wildly used data set for the evaluation of anomaly detection methods. This data set is prepared by Stolfo et al. [5] and is built based on the data captured in DARPA'98 IDS evaluation program. DARPA'98 is about 4 gigabytes of compressed raw (binary) tcpdump data of 7 weeks of network traffic, which can be processed into about 5 million connection records, each with about 100 bytes. 

Attacks fall into four main categories:
 DOS: denial-of-service, e.g. syn flood
 R2L: unauthorized access from a remote machine, e.g. guessing password
 U2R: unauthorized access to local superuser (root) privileges, e.g., various ‘buffer overflow’ attacks
probing: surveillance and other probing, e.g., port scanning
